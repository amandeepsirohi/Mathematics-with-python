# # Gradient descent in a sandpit
# 
# The supervisor of this building site doesn't have the time or patience to go digging in the sandpit herself.
# She assigns this task to one of her workers, however they only follow very specific instructions.
# The instructions take the form of a location to start searching from, and where to go subsequently if the phone is not found. The workers will try 5 further attempts after each click.
# 
# In this exercise you will look at such instructions, and see how good they are as a strategy for finding the supervisor's phone.
# 
# There is no grading for this exercise, when you are finished, close this tab to return to the course.
# 
# ## Simple example
# One idea for a set of instructions is, if you don't find the phone go one metre to the right and try again.
# See how well (or badly) this works as a strategy.
# 
# Re-run the examples multiple times to make sure you didn't just get lucky!

get_ipython().run_line_magic('run', '"readonly/sandpit-exercises.ipynb"')
sandpit_gradient(next_step)


# ## Steepest Descent
# 
# The previous strategy doens't use any of the information we have available, namely the depth of the pit, the Jacobian, or the Hessian.
# 
# We can do better by moving in a direction proportional to the Jacobian, down the slope.
# We can set an *aggression* parameter, $\gamma$ for how big the jumps should be.
# i.e. $\delta \mathbf{x} = -\gamma \mathbf{J} $
# 
# Feel free to try different values for $\gamma$.

# In[2]:


def next_step(f, J, H) :
    gamma = 0.5
    return -gamma * J

# Click into this cell and press [Shift-Enter] to start.
get_ipython().run_line_magic('run', '"readonly/sandpit-exercises.ipynb"')
sandpit_gradient(next_step)


# ## Hessian
# 
# The trouble with the previous method is it is not always clear how big to set $\gamma$ to be.
# Too big, and the jumps are too big, missing all the features.
# Too small, and it will take too long to coverge.
# 
# A way of automatically determining the jump size, is to use the Hessian, i.e., the second derivative matrix.
# 
# Then, the step size can be given as,
# $\delta \mathbf{x} = -\mathbf{H}^{-1}\mathbf{J}$
# 
# This not only sets the step size, but can also change the direction too.
# Be careful, this method is just as likely to find maxima as it is mimima.

# In[3]:


def next_step(f, J, H) :
    return -linalg.inv(H) @ J

# Click into this cell and press [Shift-Enter] to start.
get_ipython().run_line_magic('run', '"readonly/sandpit-exercises.ipynb"')
sandpit_gradient(next_step)


# ## Hybrid method
# 
# You may have noticed, that if you are sufficiently close to a stationaty point already, the Hessian method will find it in relatively few steps.
# Though in most cases, the step size is too large, and can even change the direction up hill.
# 
# We can try a hybrid method which tries the Hessian unless the step would be too big, or it would point backwards, in which case it goes back to using steepest descent.
# 
# See if you think this is any better.

# In[4]:


def next_step(f, J, H) :
    gamma = 0.5
    step = -linalg.inv(H) @ J
    if step @ -J <= 0 or linalg.norm(step) > 2 :
        step = -gamma * J
    return step

# Click into this cell and press [Shift-Enter] to start.
get_ipython().run_line_magic('run', '"readonly/sandpit-exercises.ipynb"')
sandpit_gradient(next_step)
